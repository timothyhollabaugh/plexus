// This code assumes that any keys for topological structures in the mesh are
// valid (hence the `unwrap` calls), which is very important for `Deref`.
// Topological mutations using views are dangerous if they do not consume
// `self`. If these views can be used to mutate that data, then they can also
// invalidate these constraints and cause panics. Any mutating functions should
// consume the view.
//
// Similarly, toplogical mutations could invalidate views used to reach other
// views. This means that it is unsafe for a mutable view to yield another
// mutable view, because the second view may cause mutations that invalidate
// the first. Circulators effectively map from a mutable view to orphan views,
// for example. While `into` and immutable accessor functions are okay, mutable
// accessor functions MUST yield orphans (or not exist at all).
